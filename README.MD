# Exercise 1 - Onedimensional Array
Using printf, display a string "I Love Programming!" 

# Exercise 2 - Onedimensional Array
Using gets and printf, display a string "I am a Bachelor Degree Student from Universiti Malaysia Kelantan"

# Exercise 3 - Onedimensional Array
Using fgets and puts, display a string "Practice Makes Perfect!"

# Exercise 4 - Onedimensional Array
Write a program to find the summation of array elements as follow (note: use loop in this program): 

```
num[] = {10.0, 22.5, 15.5, 32.5, 10.9, 67.9, 12.5, 11.9, 25.5, 100.0};
```

# Exercise 5 - Onedimensional Array
Write a program to display a string "Practice Makes Perfect!". Next, print 8-th element from the string as follow:

```
8-th element from the string is: _____
```

# Exercise 6 - Multidimensional Array
Write a program to display a multidimensional (2D) array as follow (note: use nested loop in this program as to read rows and columns): 

```
Element at x[0][0]: 0
Element at x[0][1]: 2
Element at x[1][0]: 4
Element at x[1][1]: 6
Element at x[2][0]: 8
Element at x[2][1]: 10
```

# Exercise 7 - Passing Array to Function
Based from Exercise 4, write a program to calculate summation of array element by passing an array to a function (note: create a function name summationArray)

# Exercise 8 - Passing Array to Function
Based from Exercise 6, write a program to display a multidimensional (2D) array by passing an array to a function (note: create a function name displayElement)

# Exercise 9 - Pointers
Write a program to display the address each of element below: (note: use loop in this program)

```
myArray[] = {1,2,3,4,5};
```

# Exercise 10 - Pointers
Create pointer name *ptr* and assigned the address of this pointer to variable name *myVariable* where the value store in *myVariable* is 100. Next, print the address and value of *ptr* as follow:

```
Address for ptr is: ____
Value for ptr is: ____
```
